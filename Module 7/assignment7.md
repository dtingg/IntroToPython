# Assignment 07

Using the tutorial from Module 7 - Lab 2: 

* Create a function that allows you to pull out a tag (passed as an argument to your function) from any URL (also passed as an argument to your function)
* Create a function to format the output in a meaningful way
* Create a function to write the formatted results to a txt file 
* Upload your script and output file to canvas for full credit

Example of what running the first function should look like for the end-user:  

> get_div(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Canada", tag="a")

Stretch goal:   
Use the tutorial [here](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/) to learn about lxml, tree, and Xpath.  Create Xpaths for the Immer barley data to create a list of the varieties and a dictionary of the barley data.  Be careful that you're getting only the data!
