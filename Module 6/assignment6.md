# Assignment 06 - Pizza Functions

Taking what we learned about functions, create a python script that will calculate the cost of pizza for movie night.  

* Get user input for the following: 
    * Number of people who want pizza
    * Average number of slices per person
    * You can store these as a single integer, or use a dictionary to map names to values, up to you
* Create the following static (unchanging) variables:
    * Pizza cost = $10.00 
    * Total slices = 8 
    * Tax rate of 9.6%
    * Tip rate of 5 -15%
    * Delivery fee of $3.99  
* Write functions to:
    * Calculate how many pizzas to order based on number of people and average slices
    * Total pizza cost
    * Cost per person  

Stretch goals:
* Add an option to calculate the tip by person or by slice.
* Update your pizza script to read in a file (txt or csv) of how many slices of pizza different people want (ex: Daniel, 3) and calculate the cost for each person individually.
* How many slices are leftover?

Example Output:  
> You need 6 pizzas
> The total cost is $78.90
> 
> Each person owed $5.26
