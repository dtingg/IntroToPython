# Assignment 03

**Assignment**  

For this assignment:

1. Create a script called hw3.py
2. Ask the user to enter a starting and ending number
    1. The user must not enter a starting number less than 1
    2. The user must enter an ending number at least 5 times greater than the starting number
    3. Create checks and error messages for the above
3. Create a list of integers in the range of the user's starting and ending numbers
4. Print out the number and index of each item in the list that is even
5. Sum all the odd numbers in the list using a for loop ( hint: append odd numbers to a list and then sum() that list )
6. Print out the cumulative sum calculated above
7. Upload your python file to Canvas.

**Example Output:**
> Please enter a starting number: 2
> 
> Please enter an ending number: 200
> 
> Even numbers in your list: 
> 
> 2 is at the 3rd index
> 
> 4 is at the 5th index... 
> 
> The sum of your number list is: 500 (I made that number up)
