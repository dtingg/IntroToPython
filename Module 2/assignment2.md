# Assignment 02
In this activity you will use what you've learned about math and string operations to create a Car Salesman program. 

**Assignment**
* Create a script called hw2.py.  
* Gather the following user input and store each item as a variable: 
    * Purchaser name
    * Purchaser address
    * Purchaser phone number (entered as 503-555-1211)
    * Car Make/Model
    * Purchase Price
* After the user inputs the above information, your program should add the following values to the sale price: 
    * Sales tax as a percent of sale price 
    * Licensing fee
    * Dealer prep fee
    * Calculate total cost (as a float)
* Assign the car a unique ID composed of the last four letters of the purchaser's last name and their area code, separated by an underscore
* Print out the information to the screen, with the same line breaks as shown in the example below
* Make sure your script runs and submit it to canvas as a .py file. 

Example of final output:
