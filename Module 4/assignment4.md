# Assignment 04

Define two lists at the top of your file (you can make them anything, feel free to be creative), such as the ones below:

> names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Cathy", "Dan", "Ed", "Frank", 
>     "Gary", "Helen", "Irene", "Jack", "Kelly", "Larry"]  
> ages = [20, 21, 18, 18, 19, 20, 20, 19, 19, 19, 22, 19] 

These lists should match up, so Aliceâ€™s age is 20, Bobâ€™s age is 21, and so on.
* Use the zip function to merge these lists into a dictionary. (What data type does zip() return? How do you coerce that to the right data type?)
* The names should be the keys, and the age should be the value. 
* Ask the user to input a user name
* Use a while loop to keep asking the user to input a user until they find someone in the dictionary, give them up to five tries by using a counter outside the while loop
* Return the user's age, as shown below

Your program should print out the response, as follows: 

> "Please input an user to find out their age: "
> "Alice" 
> "Alice is 57!" 
> 
> "Tabitha"
> "There is nobody here named Tabitha, please try again: "
