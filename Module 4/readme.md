# Assignment 04

Define two lists at the top of your file. These lists should match up.
* Use the zip function to merge these lists into a dictionary. (What data type does zip() return? How do you coerce that to the right data type?)
* The names should be the keys, and the age should be the value. 
* Ask the user to input a user name
* Use a while loop to keep asking the user to input a user until they find someone in the dictionary, give them up to five tries by using a counter outside the while loop
* Return the user's age
