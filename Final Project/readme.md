# Final Project

**What is it?**  
You create a script.

Make this as awesome, cheesy, simple, difficult as you want! But it will be graded as follows:

**Grading Criteria:**  
**Must contain 3 of the following:**  
* Include a function that takes at least two user arguments from the command line
* Contain at least one if/else statement
* Perform a calculation on a list
* Use at least one dictionary
* Have one try/except clause for every function
* Output something (write) to a file, using string formatting
* Either create a class to contain the related functions OR output a simple graph
* Write either output or a graph to a file
* Each function must be documented with comments telling us what the purpose of the function is, and what its inputs and outputs arg

Additionally, it must include docstrings telling us how to run your script.

**To Turn in:**  
Upload your final python script or jupyter notebook to Canvas

**Please note which criteria you picked for your project**  

**What you get out of this is up to you; you can make this as simple or awesome as you want!**
