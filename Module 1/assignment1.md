# Assignment 01

**Create a python script called "hw1.py"**

This script should contain:
1. Ask the user three questions and store their input as variables.
2. Combine the three answers into a sentence of your choosing.
3. Print out the final combined sentence using one of the string operations.
4. Add docstrings and comments to your code.
5. Add a link to your GitHub script or upload it to canvas.

Here's an example of what I'm looking for to get you started:

> user_name = input("What's your name? ")  
> user_age = input("How old are you? ")  
> favorite_band = input("Favorite band")
> 
> print("Wow, ", user_name, "you're ", user_age, "?!?!  
>       That's really old. No wonder you still listen to", favorite_band)

Make sure your script runs, and upload it to canvas by the due date.

**Stretch Goal!**
